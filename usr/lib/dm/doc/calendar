Calendar
========

The dev mod system has an interface to Google calendar.


Overview
--------

The interface to the Google calendar permits creating and updating
Google calendar entries. It's also possible to display all calendar
entries. The scripts act as an interface to Google calendar but there is
nothing magical going on. You can access the entries and
edit/modify/display them from Google's normal web page interface at
www.gmail.com.


Creating a calendar entry
-------------------------

There are two methods of creating a calendar entry.
1) The input system.
2) Editing calendar events with calendar_edit.sh.


1) Use the input system for creating a calendar entry.

$ input

    Sbjct: c August 7, 2009 2pm to 3pm Dentist appointment
    Descr: Dr. Dennis Bruce Nuhn
    Palmerston Phone: (519) 343-2720

The subject must follow a specific format.

    Sbjct: c August 7, 2009 2pm to 3pm Dentist appointment
           | \____________/ \________/ \_________________/
    Code --+      |             |               |
    Date ---------+             |               |
    Time -----------------------+               |
    What ---------------------------------------+

    Code: Start with a lowercase 'c' followed by at least one space.

    Date: Indicate the date of the calendar event. The following
          formats are acceptable:
          January 31, 2009
          Jan 31, 2009
          Jan 31                # The year is assumed to be this year
          2009-01-31

    Time: Indicate the start time and optionally the end time. Most
          intuitive formats are acceptable.
          7pm
          19:00
          7pm to 9pm
          7 pm to 9:30 pm
          7-9pm                 # this is assumed 7pm to 9pm
          7 to 9pm
          9-11am                # this is assumed 9am to 11 am
          11 am - 3 pm
          19:00 to 21:00
          19:00 - 21:00

    What: Any text after the time is entered as the calendar "What"

The Descr is optional. What ever text is entered for the description is
stored in the calendar description field. Descriptions should *not*
contain blank lines.

It will take several minutes for the input system to update the calendar.

2) Editing calendar events with calendar_edit.sh.

Editing calendar events is covered in detail in the "Updating a calendar
entry" section. To add a new entry, run calendar_edit.sh and add a new
calendar event *without an id header*. At minimum the event has to have a
what and when header.

    what: New calendar event.
    when: 2009-08-10 19:30:00
    until: 2009-08-10 21:30:00
    description: This is a new calendar event.

Save the calendar events file and the new event will be added. Any
number of events can be added in one edit. It's also possible to modify
existing events, delete existing events and add new events in one run of
calendar_edit.sh. More details are available in the following sections.


Displaying your calendar
------------------------

The calendar.sh script is use for displaying calendar entries.

The script has two modes, short and long (default). The short version is
useful for getting a quick glance of the events for the day of month.
The long version is for viewing the specific details of the event.

$ calendar.sh -m short

    2009-08-10 19:30:00 KW-Lug
    2009-08-14 10:50:00 Dentist Appointment

$ calendar.sh -m long
$ calendar.sh

    id: pj7vqq5akflo5btmpgbtv13nkc
    what: KW-Lug
    when: 2009-08-10 19:30:00
    until: 2009-08-10 21:30:00
    where:
    description:  Heuther Hotel (Boardroom) 59 King St N, Waterloo (519)
    886-3350 http://www.kwlug.org/
    remind: 60 minutes by email

    id: h1vqotvj45rmkaf86rr7cru8cc
    what: Dentist Appointment
    when: 2009-08-14 10:50:00
    until: 2009-08-14 11:59:00
    where:
    description:  Name: Dr. Dennis Bruce Nuhn Address: 30 Minto Rd, PO
    Box 580 City/Town: Palmerston ON Postal code: N0G 2P0 Phone: (519)
    343-2720
    remind: 60 minutes by email


The script has options to filter the calendar entries displayed and
control the sort order.

## Display all calendar entries for the month of July, 2009.
$ calendar.sh -f 2009-07-01 2009-07-31

## Get help to see other options
$ calendar.sh -h


Updating a calendar entry
-------------------------

To update an calendar entry, run calender_edit.sh. (Or "ce" if the alias
is created. See Aliases below.)

$ calendar_edit.sh

The script will open a vim session and allow you to edit all calendar
entries from todays date onward. Make changes with vim, save your
changes, and the calendar entries will be uploaded to Google calendar.

The general format of the edited file should be left as is. You can edit
the values but do not change the headers. Also do *not* change the id
values. They represent the ids of the calendar entries as stored in the
Google system.

The calendar_edit.sh has several options that allow you to filter the
calendar entries you edit.

## Edit all calendar entries for the month of July, 2009.
$ calendar_edit.sh -f 2009-07-01 2009-07-31

## Get help
$ calendar_edit.sh -h

Any calendar entries not in the edit session remain untouched.

WARNING: A blank line is used to separate calendar entries in an edit
session. Do not put blank lines in the description section of a calendar
entry as text after a blank line will be dropped.


Deleting a calendar entry
-------------------------

To delete a calendar entry, simply change the "what:" field to DELETE.

For example, consider this calendar entry.

    id: pj7vqq5akflo5btmpgbtv13nkc
    what: Meeting with Uncle Sam.
    when: 2009-08-10 19:30:00
    until: 2009-08-10 21:30:00
    where: 123 Main St E Kitchener ON
    description: Talk about the latest release.
    remind: 60 minutes by email

The same calendar entry has been modified below and is now flagged to be deleted.

    id: pj7vqq5akflo5btmpgbtv13nkc
    what: DELETE
    when: 2009-08-10 19:30:00
    until: 2009-08-10 21:30:00
    where: 123 Main St E Kitchener ON
    description: Talk about the latest release.
    remind: 60 minutes by email

NOTES:

* See "Updating a calendar entry" for instructions on how to change a
  calendar entry.
* The keyword DELETE must be one word, uppercase
* The id of the calendar entry must remain unchanged in order for the
  system to be able identify the specific calendar entry to delete.


Notification
------------

Google calendar has a notification feature. Notifications can be added
to calendar events using the "remind" header.

This calendar event is configured to send an email notification 1 hour
(60 minutes) before the event.

    id: pj7vqq5akflo5btmpgbtv13nkc
    what: Meeting with Uncle Sam.
    when: 2009-08-10 19:30:00
    until: 2009-08-10 21:30:00
    description: Talk about the latest release.
    remind: 60 minutes by email

The syntax for the remind value is:

    <nn> minutes by <method>

where
    <nn> is the number of minutes
    <method> is the notification method, one of: alert email sms.

The notification methods are:

    alert - pop-up alert on gmail page.
    email - an email is sent to gmail address
    sms   - text message is sent to your mobile phone

Multiple notifications are supported. This calendar event is configured
to send an email notification 1 hour (60 minutes) before the event and
send an SMS text message 10 minutes before the event.

    id: pj7vqq5akflo5btmpgbtv13nkc
    what: Meeting with Uncle Sam.
    when: 2009-08-10 19:30:00
    until: 2009-08-10 21:30:00
    description: Talk about the latest release.
    remind: 60 minutes by email
    remind: 10 minutes by sms

To modify a notification, simply edit the calendar event. See "Updating
a calendar entry" for more info.

To remove a notification, simple edit the calendar event and delete the
remind line associated with the event.

Unfortunately the Google python API does not permit access to the Google
Calendar default notifiction setting. Calendar events added using the
dev mod system interface will not have a default notification setting.
When calendar events are created with the input system, the event will
be created with no notifications.

Is you wish to be reminded by SMS you have to register your phone with
Google. Click  "Set up your mobile phone to receive notifications" and
follow instructions. This is a one-time setup.
