Email Tagging
=============

Email can be tagged so they are associated with a mod. The system is
designed so as long as one email is tagged, the complete thread the email
belongs to is associated with a mod. A mairix-like search can be
initiated from the cli, creating a search folder in mutt containing all
email associated with a particular mod. Very nice.


Tag Format
==========

An email is tagged by adding a custom header field. The format of the
header field is displayed below. In this example, the mod id is 12345.
The tag is case sensitive.

    X-DM-Mod-Id: 12345

An email can have multiple tags if it is associated with several mods.
Add one tab per line.

    X-DM-Mod-Id: 12345
    X-DM-Mod-Id: 34567
    X-DM-Mod-Id: 45678


Tagging With Mutt
=================

To associate an email with a mod, simply add an X-DM-Mod-Id field
to the email header. This can be done manually or using a script.

Mutt permits editing headers when sending email and it allows you to add
a header to an existing email. It very basic, it relies on you using
your editor, so we created a vim function to simplify that.


Configuration:

## Update vim function
$ cp HTMLtag.vim ~/.vim/functions/

## Update .vimrc with key binding

$ vi ~/.vimrc

    ## Add this line, you may wish to use a different key binding
    map ,x <ESC>:call XDMModIdInsert()<CR>|         " Insert X-DM-Mod-Id header



Usage:

Editing headers with mutt.

1. When sending

When sending an email, if you want to associate it with a mod, press E
when at the send-menu, ie just prior to pressing y=Send. Mutt opens the
email with vim again and displays the headers. Move the cursor to the
end of the header items, and press the keybinding, eg ,x , and vim will
prompt with "X-DM-Mod-Id: " at the command line. Enter the id of the mod
you want the email associated with. Enter nothing to default to the
current mod.

The press 'E' may be annoying. Mutt has a edit_headers option that when
set will display headers by default whenever you compose your email in
vim. This may be preferred since it doesn't take an extra step and the
visible headers may remind you so you don't forget to add the mod id
header.

To make headers always editable:

$ vi ~/.mutt/muttrc

    set edit_headers = yes

2. Existing email.

To add a header to an existing email, or one you receive in your inbox,
simply press e in either index or pager mode and edit the mod in vim.



Sorting tagged emails.

If you want to sort all emails with the X-DM-Mod-Id header into specific
mail folder, this should work:

$ cat ~/.fdm.conf

    match "^X-DM-Mod-Id:.*" in headers actions "dm"
    action "dm" maildir "${inbox}"


Tagging With a Script
=====================

Mutt has a -H option that allows you to compose an email from a draft
file. This option has a nice surprise: it allows you to use mutt to
compose an email from the cli using mutt's interface (abook, vim
editor),  send it, and drop back to the cli. If you create a temporary
template file with the mod header field included, then run mutt with the
-H option, you can compose an email and the tag is pre-added.

The script compose_email.sh was created to do the dirty work for us, and
an 'ce' alias to that script makes a handy shortcut. Now when you want
to compose an email related to the current mod, I just type 'ce'.

Configuration:

## Create alias

$ cat ~/.bash_aliases

    alias ce='$HOME/dm/bin/compose_email.sh'


Usage:

## Compose an email tagged with the current mod id
$ ce

## Compose an email tagged with a mod id other than current
$ ce 12345


Email Search
============

Mairix is used to search email. Mairix does not index on custom headers
so I created a wrapper script. There was talk on the mairix mailing list
about implementing it but the main developer got busy and never got
around to it. We created a wrapper script, mairix_mod.sh, that works
well. It uses grep to find mail files with the X-DM-Mod-Id tags, then
extracts the Message-ID tag from the email file, then uses mairix to
search for mail with that message id.

Given an mod id, mairix_mod.sh puts all emails related to the mod and
their threads in the mutt search folder. Without an id, it defaults to
the current mod.

## Create alias for mairix_mod.sh

$ cat $HOME/.bash_aliases

    alias mm='$HOME/dm/bin/mairix_mod.sh'

## Searching for emails associated with a mod.

$ mm                    # Search for current mod id
$ mm 12345              # Search for a specific mod id

    # Go to mutt search folder and emails and threads should be there.




# vim: ft=dm
