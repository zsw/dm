Mail2Jabber
===========

The mail2jabber.sh script is used to convert an email to a jabber
message.


Setup
-----

1. Create an email account for jabber messages.

I created a jabberjimk@gmail.com account to handle jabber messages. Any
email message sent to that account will produce a message in my jabber
client (weechat) rather than in my email client. The email account is no
different than any other email account. The sorting explained next does
all the work.



2. Configure fdm to sort jabber messages.

Here are the configuration lines in $HOME/.fdm.conf that handle
converting email messages to jabber.

    match "^To: jabberjimk@gmail.com" in headers actions { "l-input" "mail2jabber" "mark_as_read"}
    action "l-input" maildir "${mail}/pl/input"
    action "mail2jabber" exec "$HOME/dm/bin/mail2jabber.sh %[mail_file]"
    action "mark_as_read" exec "$HOME/dm/bin/mark_as_read.sh %[mail_file]"


3. Start weechat.

The mail2jabber.sh dumps the email message in the weechat fifo pipe,
$HOME/.weechat/weechat_fifo_*. Weechat has to be running for this to
work.


Debug
-----

To troubleshoot the whole process, send an email to the account you created
for jabber messages and see if it creates a message in weechat. Remember
the message won't appear until your system fetches email.

It is possible to debug the mail2jabber.sh script by running it from the
cli.

## Start weechat if not already running
$ weechat-curses

## Find an existing maildir email file
## and pass it as a parameter to mail2jabber.sh

$ mail2jabber.sh ~/.mail/pl/cur/1220476681.000265.mbox:2,S.

## Then check weechat for a message


# vim: ft=dm
