Postponing Mods
===============

Mods can be postponed.

Use the pp alias to postpone the set mod.

$ pp next thursday 10:00

To postpone a mod not currently set, you can temporarily set the mod,
postpone it, then restore the set mod.

$ sm 12345 pp next thursday 10:00 sm

Or, you can use postpone.sh


$ postpone.sh -m 12345 next thursday 10:00


The postpone scripts use the "date" command to convert the postpone
time. In particular the --date option is used from a human readable date
string to a timestamp. The format string used is "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S".

Here are some acceptable postpone times. Some are intuitive. Some not so
much.


$ pp 2008-12-09 17:00:00        ## Indicate the particular date and time using military time.
$ pp 2008-12-09                 ## Indicates a particular date, 00:00:00 is assumed for time.

$ pp tomorrow                   ## Returns tomorrows date, the current time is assumed for time.
$ pp tomorrow 9am               ## Returns tomorrows date, with 09:00:00 for time.

$ pp next thursday              ## Returns the date of the following Thursday.
                                ## If a time is not indicated, 00:00:00 is assumed
                                ## WARNING: if today is Thursday, returns today!!
                                ## Use next week if you want the following Thursday

$ pp next week                  ## Returns the date one week from today
                                ## If a time is not indicated, the current time is assumed

$ pp next month                 ## One month from today. Similar to next week
$ pp next year                  ## One year from today.

$ pp next sunday 17:00          ## Returns the date of the follow Sunday, with timestamp 17:00:00
$ pp next sunday 5pm            ## Same thing.
$ pp next sunday 17             ## Same thing.

$ pp next week thursday         ## Returns the first thursday

Some other settings that are pretty intuitive:

$ pp 1 minute
$ pp 30 minutes

$ pp 1 hour
$ pp 3 hours

$ pp 1 day
$ pp 5 days

$ pp 1 week
$ pp 4 weeks

$ pp 1 month
$ pp 6 months

$ pp 1 year
$ pp 2 years

$ pp 1 year 2 months 3 days

If you want to test syntax, use the date command

$ date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" --date="next thursday 17:00"

See the date man pages, DATE STRING section for more details.


Since the returned date is not always obvious, some commands return
00:00:00 and others return the current time, you can always indicate a
time just to be sure. In many cases when postponing a mod, the time
isn't all that important, you just want the mod prioritize first thing
that day. In that case add a 0 for the time. It will translate to
00:00:00.

$ pp tomorrow 0
$ pp next thursday 0
$ pp next week 0


Details
-------

Each mod is a subdirectory with attribute files. An optional attribute
file is the "hold" file. If it exists and contains a timestamp in the
last line, the mod will be put on hold until that time.

The hold file may contain commented lines. If a mod is repeatedly put on
hold and taken off hold, the previous hold times are commented out but
left in the hold file for reference.

The hold file is a text file and can be edited with a text editor if
desired.

You can manually create a hold file as follows:

$ echo "2008-12-09 17:30:00" > $HOME/dm/mods/12345/hold

This command will put mod 12345 on hold until the prescribed time.


# vim: ft=dm
